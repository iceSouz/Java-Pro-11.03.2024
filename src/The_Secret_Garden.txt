When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the
most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin
body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been
born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English
Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go
to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she
handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she
must keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was
kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also.
She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and
she never felt that she was not wanted, which, perhaps, was the reason why she was a disagreeable child. She was
not actually lonely, but she felt very lowly. One of the best things about the old English manor house was its garden.
